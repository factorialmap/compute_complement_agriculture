## Goals of this folder

Provide additional code in R and Python to practice the exercises contained in the book

#### Descriptive Statistics
- **Calculation group means** : Chapter 2

#### Simple Correlation
- **Relationships between quantitative treatment structures** : Chapter 3 

#### One-sample t-test
- **Compares the mean of a single sample to a known population mean** It determines if there's a significant difference between the sample and the population : Chapter 4
 
#### Two-sample t-test
- **Compares the means of two separate, unrelated groups** to see if there's a significant difference between them(Independent sample) : Chapter 4

#### Paired t-test
- **Special use case of One-sample t-test, and evaluate whether differences in paired values(e.g., before and after intervention)** to determine if there's a significant difference : Chapter 4

#### Analysis of Variance(ANOVA)
- **Compares the means of 3 or more groups** to determine if at least one group is significantly different. Analyzes spread within and between groups : Chapter 5

#### One-Way ANOVA
- **Compare means across 3 or more groups based on 1 independent factor(variable)** For example comparing exame scores across different teaching methods : Chapter 5.1

#### Multi-Factor ANOVA
- **Examines interactions between 2 or more independent factors(variables) on a continuous outcome(response)** For example analizing exam scores based on teaching method(factorA) and student age(factorB) : Chapter 5.2

#### Linear Regression
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Chapter 6

#### Analysis of Covariance(ANCOVA)
- **Compares means across 3 or more groups based on 1 independent factor(variable), while controlling for 1 additional varible(covariate)** Example Comparing exam scores across teaching methods, considering prior knowledge : Chapter 7

#### Mixed Models ANOVA 
- **Combines fixed effects with random effects**: Chapter 8
- Basic conceps: Fixed effects(categorical variables, like group comparisons or predictors), random effects(variations within groups or individuals).
- Example: Analyzing student performance across schools, considering school-specific variations.

#### Mixed Models Regression
- **Includes fixed effects and random effects to analyze relationships**: Chapter 9
- Base conceps: Fixed effects(categorical variables, like group comparisons or predictors), random effects(variations within groups or individuals).
- Example: Predicting student performance based on hours studied, considering variations between classrooms

#### Logistic Regression
- **Analyzes relationships between predictors variables and the binnary outcome(yes/no, 0/1, positive/negative)**: Chapter 10
- Basic conceps: Probability based model with 3 different types binary,  multinomial, and ordinal logistic regression.
- Example: Analyzing intervention success.
